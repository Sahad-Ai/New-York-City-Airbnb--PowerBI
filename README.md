🏙️ New York City Airbnb Analysis
This project presents an in-depth analysis of Airbnb listings in New York City for the year 2019. Using data visualization and analytical tools, we explore key trends influencing pricing, availability, host activity, and market competition. The findings offer valuable insights for hosts looking to optimize their listings, guests searching for affordable stays, and market analysts studying short-term rental trends.
